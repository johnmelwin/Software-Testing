# Software Testing Repository

## Repository Summary

This repository contains my implementation of various software testing processes. Software testing processes include JUnit testing, Python mocking, mutation testing, automated UI testing, and code smell fixing.

## Overviewüîç

The Software Testing Repository focuses on exploring different software testing techniques and methodologies to ensure the quality and reliability of software applications. By leveraging the power of JUnit, Python mocking libraries, mutation testing frameworks, automated UI testing tools, and code analysis techniques, the project aims to demonstrate effective testing practices that can be applied in real-world software development scenarios.

## Implemented Software Testing Processes

The repository includes the following implemented software testing processes:

- üß™**JUnit Testing**: This directory contains JUnit tests that validate the individual units of code in Java applications. It demonstrates the usage of JUnit, a popular testing framework for Java, to ensure the correctness of individual units of code, such as methods and classes.

-  üêç **Python Mocking**: This directory includes examples of Python mocking, which is a technique used to simulate external dependencies or behavior during testing. It showcases the usage of popular mocking frameworks in Python to isolate and test specific components of a system.

-  üî¨ **Mutation Testing**: The Mutation Testing directory presents the implementation of mutation testing, a technique that involves introducing small changes (mutations) into the source code and verifying if the test suite can detect those mutations. It illustrates how mutation testing can enhance the effectiveness of testing by identifying weaknesses in the test suite.

- üåê  **Automated UI Testing/SeleniumTestFiles**: The Automated UI Testing directory focuses on automated UI testing using Selenium, a widely used tool for web application testing. It provides sample test files that demonstrate how to automate the interaction with web elements and validate the behavior of the user interface.
